# FPGA Synthesizer
### This Repository has all the necessary source files for a piano-like Synthesizer made in VHDL. The board used is the NexysA7100t. The PMOD Keypad is plugged into JA and the dac speaker module is connected to the top row of JA.

### When the bitstream is uploaded to the board, the keypad will act like a piano (where each key corresponds to a note). The keypad is capable of playing one full octave (from notes C5 to C6). It can be used to play some basic melodies/songs. Note that only one note can be played at a time due to limitations in the implementation and the keypad itself.
